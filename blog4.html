                    <p class="mt-3">As we all know, 2020 did not go the way we planned. A worldwide pandemic sheltered us in place, closing many of our businesses, jobs, and social lives down for good. Strangely, even with more time on most of our hands, it seems as if most people did not know what to do with it. Instead of unifying together as a country, and more broadly, as a world to fight the virus, we ended up becoming even MORE isolated, due to the nature of the virus itself, but also because of the way that our culture and political conversation has been heading.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3">I wanted to share a brief story that I recently heard for the first time in a while that summarizes how we should be serving Jesus as our lord and savior. It is the story of the three trees, and it is a story that my family reads every year as we gather to Celebrate Jesus birth and Christmas. It is the story of the three trees.
</p>
<p class="mt-3">We were not able to put away these many differences, and so, it cost us dearly. Another year of our lives away from family, another year of wasted time for (most) of us not to achieve our goals, and most shockingly.
    I am however, finding myself wishing that I was in church more and more often. I yearn for that small sense of normality, friendship, and stewardship. I want to go and have live music, and maybe that's petty, but I want that. And finally, most of all, I miss the routine that enables me to communicate with God and the regular schedule that I can reach out sincerely and publicly at least once a week. I miss my family that I would see every week. I miss our after church family dinners when we  would discuss our lives, God's plans, and exciting life events.
    With these stepping stones, accountability and events gone, life for sure seems simpler, but emptier. We may have gained time to ourselves, but lost time with God and his family along with our own extended families. We may even have gained a fair amount of achievements and position in our careers, but we have lost all resemblance of ourselves. In other words, we gained the world, but in the process, may have lost our souls.

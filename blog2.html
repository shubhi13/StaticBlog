                    <p class="mt-3"> As I write this, I am thinking about how many people are in this world that have stress, anxiety, worry, and depression. It is a worsening pandemic that effects more people than any virus ever could. Mental health concerns are VERY very real and have an overall effect on someone that can truly be extremely detrimental to their health and others
                        In 2020, almost 1/4 adults in America reported considering killing themselves at one point during the year. That statistic is truly alarming.</p>
                    <p>There are many reasons that this was higher than usual in 2020 (pandemic, unemployment, political turmoil, etc.) but the scary part is the trend happens to be growing. We cannot solely blame it on the Pandemic and the consequences that came with it. We can probably blame it on a lot of things, but most importantly we can blame it on Isolation, or as we now know it, "social" distancing.</p>
                    <p> The truth is that we continue to be alone more and more as time goes by. We no longer hangout with friends or family, some of us avoided public places and interactions a long time before Covid started. We have lost respect for one another, but maybe most importantly, we lost respect for our God and for ourselves.
                        We have deemphasized the importance that others hold in our lives, and therefore lost crucial aspects and elements to life we need. As a society, we no longer give extra patience to others, we no longer help others unless we get something back. We talk before we listen to others,  and speak before we think. In fact, we are mindless, believing what is told to us by others because we are too lazy to do the research ourselves. This is the problem... We don't put in effort anymore.  As a society, everything is given, not earned, everything is expected, not taken as a gift of thankfulness but rather an expectation.</p>
